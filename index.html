        <h2 class="head">OSI-Model :</h2> The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that
        standardizes the
        functions of a
        telecommuni-cation into seven layers, allowing for interoperability between different systems and network
        protocols.

        TCP / IP ( Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol ) is a communi-cation standard
        that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network. It consists of four
        layers.
